# Reproduction of GAT model

This repository is an implementation of [Graph Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903). 


## Requirements

To install requirements:

executing environment.yml file which deals with dependencies

Just run jupyter notebook from you Anaconda console and it will open up a session in your default browser.


## Training, Evaluation

To train and evaluate the model(s) in the paper, run below scripts:

The Annotated GAT (Cora)-Code.ipynb

The Annotated GAT (PPI)-Code.ipynb




## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on :

### [Image Classification on ImageNet](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet)

| Model name         |   Test Accuracy | 
| ------------------ |---------------- | 
| GAT                |     0.83        |    
| GCN                |     0.762       | 

| Model name         | Test Accuracy  | 
| ------------------ |----------------| 
| GAT                |     0.978      |  
| GraphSAGE          |     0.716      |
