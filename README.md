# Reproduction of GAT model

This repository is an implementation of [Graph Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903). 


## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
executing environment.yml file which deals with dependencies
```
Just run jupyter notebook from you Anaconda console and it will open up a session in your default browser.


## Training, Evaluation

To train and evaluate the model(s) in the paper, run below scripts:
The Annotated GAT (Cora)-Code
The Annotated GAT (PPI)-Code




## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on :

### [Image Classification on ImageNet](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet)

| Model name         |   Test Accuracy |
